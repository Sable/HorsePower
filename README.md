# HorsePower

HorsePower is designed for optimizing database queries with modern hardware.
At its core is **HorseIR**, which is a well-designed array-based intermediate
representation (IR) for database queries.  Based on HorseIR, sophisticated
compiler optimizations can be applied for database operations.  Moreover, using
array programming offers a promising option for performance speedup with
fine-grained parallelism.


## Project Overview

<p align="center"><img src="docs/figures/horse-flow2.png" width="90%"/></p>
<p align="center">Figure 1. The workflow of the HorsePower framework.</p>

In summer 2017, we started this project from scratch.  The workflow of the
HorsePower framework can be found in Figure 1.
A candidate of the source language is our *HorseIR* language which is an
extension of standard SQL.  The Horse language is designed for data analytics
with extended SQL features.
At the current stage, we adopt execution plans from standard database SQL queries
and MATLAB code.
We provide a front end for parsing and transforming source code to HorseIR.
After the optimization phases, multiple back-ends are supported.
Static analyses and code optimizations are performed before the target code is generated.
On the other hand, we provide an interpreter which allows running programs directly.

In HorsePower, we focus on the following parts.

    - Design and implementation of array-based intermediate representation (IR)
    - Static analysis for an array-based IR (i.e. HorseIR)
    - Query optimizations with compiler optimizations
    - Fine-grained primitive functions and highly tuned libraries


## Installation

Download the repository

    git clone git@github.com:Sable/HorsePower.git

Setup the environment variable `HORSE_BASE`

    cd HorsePower && export HORSE_BASE=$PWD

Installation with the following command line  (About 13 mins)

    (cd libs && sh deploy_linux.sh)

After installation, new folders created as follows.

    - libs/include
    - libs/lib
    - libs/pcre2

Note, it is recommended to use gcc 8.1.0 or higher and additional library
`uuid-dev` may be required during the installation.

### Build and Run

There are multiple versions developing under `src/horseir/`.
For each version, you can find a running script `run.sh` which builds an
executable and runs it with proper parameters.
You are recommended to use the latest version as this project is still under
active development.

To learn how to run, type

    (cd src/horseir/v3 && ./run.sh)      # show usage
