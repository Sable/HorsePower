# Optimization in HorseIR

## Overview

## Static analysis

Intra-procedural optimizations

- Constant propagation (intra)
- Common Sub-expression Elimination (CSE)
- Dead block elimination
- Peephole

[Inter-procedural
optimizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization),

- Procedural inlining
- Inter-procedural dead code elimination
- Inter-procedural constant propagation
- Procedure reordering

Inter-procedural analysis (before actual optimizations)

- Alias analysis
- Array access analysis
- Construction of a call graph
